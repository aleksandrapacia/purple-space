# purple-space
## Descritpion
#### PurpleSpace is an app for every space geek. There are a few helpful functions - **checking ISS position**, **moon map** and **checking moon phase**. This is an #### app for android build with buildozer. I use Linux for it.
## Issues
#### Unfortunately since I haven't been working on it for a month, there are some issues connected with using it on android phone. Still haven't figured out why the #### app crushes when I try to run it.
